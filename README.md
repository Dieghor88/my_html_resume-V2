## <div align="center">Converting my Adobe Illustrator résumé into a HTML/CSS one. </div>  
  

- 💻 This is the second version of my HTML/CSS résumé project.   
  

- 👨‍💻 This time I managed to organize the < div > more easily.   
  

- 🔳 Differently from the first time, thiss time I managed to keep everything centered...  
  

- 😠 Except for the "bookmark" that, for some reason, is not centered with the rest of the content while  I resize the browser window.
